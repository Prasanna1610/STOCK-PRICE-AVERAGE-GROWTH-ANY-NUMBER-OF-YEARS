# STOCK-PRICE-AVERAGE-GROWTH-ANY-NUMBER-OF-YEARS
My goal for the project was to build a code that would return me the average growth of any particular stock for a particular day of the month. It would require a data set containing the closing stock prices by the respective dates of a time period.
By running this project, you get an idea of which day of the month, will be the best to invest in stock to gain maximum profits without breaking the cycle of not investing on a particular day of the coming months in the market because it is a holiday.
